What I want, you've got
And it might be hard to handle
But like the flame that burns the candle
The candle feeds the flame, yeah yeah
What I've got's full stock of thoughts and dreams that scatter
You pull them all together
And how, I can't explain,
Oh yeah, well well you
You make my dreams come true
Well well you, oh yeah
You make my dreams come true
Girl oh yeah
On a night when bad dreams become a screamer
When they're messin' with a dreamer
I can laugh it in the face
Twist and shout my way out
And wrap yourself around me
'Cause I ain't the way you found me
And I'll never be the same, oh yeah
Well 'cause you,
You make my dreams come true, oh yeah
Well well you, ooh ooh
You make my dreams come true, whoa yeah
Well listen to this, oh
I'm down on the daydream
Oh that sleepwalk should be over by now
I know
Ah you, yeah yeah you make my dreams come true, oh yeah
I've been waiting for, waiting for you girl, oh yeah
You make my dreams come true
Make you make you make,
I've been waiting for, waiting for you girl
All night
You make my dreams come true, oh whoa whoa
I've been waiting for, waiting for, waiting for, waiting for,
Waiting for, waiting for, waiting for
Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I've been waiting for you girl
